## Understanding CI/CD and its Business benefits.

■	As we know, technology plays a crucial role in driving business growth and competitiveness. it's essential to stay up-to-date with the latest tools and practices. One such practice is Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

■	CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) is a software development practice that helps teams automate the building, testing, and deployment of software.

■	Continuous Integration (CI) is the process of automatically compiling and testing code changes as they are made by developers. Every time a developer checks in their code to a shared repository, the CI tool automatically builds the application and runs tests to ensure that the code changes do not break any existing functionality. This helps to catch issues early in the development process, reducing the risk of bugs and errors creeping into the software.

■	Continuous Deployment (CD) is the process of automatically deploying new code changes to production environments. Once the code has been built and tested by the CI system, it can be automatically deployed to the cloud-based infrastructure where the application is hosted. This process ensures that the most up-to-date version of the software is always running in production, without any manual intervention needed.
